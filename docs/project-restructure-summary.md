# Project Restructuring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Build Script
- Renamed `build/build.bin` to `build.sh` in the project root
- Updated the build script to work with the new directory structure
- Made the build script executable

### 2. Reorganized Directory Structure
- Created a modern, professional directory structure:
  ```
  nmgui/
  ├── src/              # Source code
  │   └── nmgui/        # Main package
  │       ├── ui/       # UI components
  │       ├── __init__.py
  │       ├── __main__.py
  │       ├── models.py
  │       └── network_service.py
  ├── docs/             # Documentation
  ├── tests/            # Test files
  ├── dist/             # Distribution files (created during build)
  ├── build_env/        # Build environment
  ├── venv/             # Virtual environment
  ├── build.sh          # Build script
  ├── setup.py          # Setup configuration
  ├── pyproject.toml    # Modern Python packaging
  ├── requirements.txt  # Dependencies
  ├── README.md         # Project documentation
  ├── LICENSE           # License file
  └── nmgui.desktop     # Desktop entry
  ```

### 3. Updated Import Paths
- Updated all import paths to use the new package structure
- All modules now use relative imports within the `nmgui` package

### 4. Created Modern Packaging Files
- Added `setup.py` for traditional Python packaging
- Added `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- Updated `README.md` with proper documentation

### 5. Improved Naming Conventions
- Renamed `main.py` to `__main__.py` for proper Python module execution
- Used consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Simplified directory structure with minimal subfolders

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Professional Organization**: Follows widely accepted Python project structure
2. **Easy Installation**: Can be installed as a proper Python package
3. **Clear Separation**: Distinct separation between source code, documentation, and tests
4. **Modern Packaging**: Supports both traditional and modern Python packaging
5. **Simplified Building**: Build script is now in the project root for easy access
6. **Proper Module Structure**: Can be executed as a module with `python -m nmgui`

## Usage

To run the application directly:
```bash
source build_env/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=src python -m nmgui
```

To build a standalone executable:
```bash
./build.sh
```

To install as a package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
